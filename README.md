# Bayesian Test Results Calculator ðŸ“Š

An interactive web-based tool designed to help understand the often counter-intuitive results of diagnostic tests using Bayes' Theorem. This calculator visually and textually demonstrates how the base rate (prevalence) of a condition significantly impacts the true probability of having that condition given a positive test result. It serves as an educational resource to combat the base rate fallacy and provide a clearer understanding of conditional probability in real-life scenarios.

## Demo
**[Live Demo](https://edisedis777.github.io/Bayesian-Test-Results-Calculator/)** ðŸ‘ˆ Click here to try it out!

## Features

*   **Interactive Sliders:** Adjust the Prevalence (Base Rate), Test Sensitivity, and False Positive Rate.
*   **Visual Representation:** Compare the Prior Probability (Prevalence) and the Posterior Probability side-by-side with dynamic bar charts.
*   **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.

## How It Works

This calculator applies **Bayes' Theorem** to a common diagnostic testing scenario. The core formula implemented is:

`P(Condition | Positive) = [Sensitivity * Prevalence] / [(Sensitivity * Prevalence) + (False Positive Rate * (1 - Prevalence))]`

Where:

*   **P(Condition | Positive):** The probability you actually have the condition *given* a positive test result (This is what the calculator outputs).
*   **Sensitivity:** The probability of a positive test *if* you have the condition (`P(Positive | Condition)`).
*   **Prevalence:** The overall probability of having the condition in the population *before* testing (`P(Condition)`).
*   **False Positive Rate:** The probability of a positive test *if* you do *not* have the condition (`P(Positive | No Condition)`).
*   **(1 - Prevalence):** The probability of *not* having the condition (`P(No Condition)`).

The user adjusts the `Prevalence`, `Sensitivity`, and `False Positive Rate` using sliders, and the calculator computes and displays `P(Condition | Positive)` along with interpretations and visualizations.

## Usage

1.  **Open the Calculator:** Access the [Live Demo] or open the `index.html` file locally.
2.  **Adjust Inputs:** Use the sliders to set:
    *   The **Base rate (prevalence)** of the condition you're considering.
    *   The **Test sensitivity** (true positive rate) of the diagnostic test.
    *   The **False positive rate** of the test.
3.  **Observe Results:**
    *   The main **Probability Result** updates instantly.
    *   The **Interpretation** text explains the result in context.
    *   The **Visual Representation** bars change to reflect the prior vs. posterior probability.
4.  **Learn More:**
    *   Review the **Parameter Summary** in the input section to connect the sliders to the formula.
    *   Read the **How It Works** section for the formula breakdown.
    *   Explore the **Key Insights** for common takeaways.
    *   Check the **Historical Context** for background on Bayes' Theorem.
5.  **Toggle Dark Mode:** Use the switch in the top-right corner for your preferred theme.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
*   **CSS3:** Styling, layout (Flexbox), responsiveness (Media Queries), and dark mode implementation.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:**

## Potential Future Enhancements

*   Option to input Test Specificity (1 - False Positive Rate) instead of FPR.
*   Display intermediate calculation steps (numerator/denominator values).
*   Add a glossary defining key terms (Prevalence, Sensitivity, Specificity, Posterior, etc.).
*   Include alternative visualizations like natural frequency trees.

## Historical Context & Acknowledgements

This tool demonstrates a concept formalized by **Thomas Bayes** (1701-1761), posthumously published by **Richard Price** (1763), and independently developed and popularized by **Pierre-Simon Laplace** (1774). Bayes' Theorem is a cornerstone of probability theory and finds critical applications in statistics, science, machine learning, medicine, and countless other fields.
